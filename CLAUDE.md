# CLAUDE.md

The agentic planner is a system that takes in signals about what to build in a repo and
tries to optimistically generate specs that can then be handed off to other coding
agents to actually build.  Signals may come from many different sources, including
GitHub.  Specs are generated by running a Claude Code agent working with the real
target repo.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend is a Next.js app written in TypeScript
- All backend code is Python 3.12 managed via poetry with a FastAPI server
- State is stored in PostgreSQL, which also is a poor man's job queue

## Key Locations

- `frontend/` holds all the frontend Next.js code
- `backend/main.py` entrypoint to the API server
- `backend/worker` background worker that is responsible for actually cloning the target
  repos and managing a Claude Code session to attempt ot generate the spec

## Key Commands

- `make fronted` start the frontend app
- `make backend` start the backend API server
- `make worker` start the background worker
